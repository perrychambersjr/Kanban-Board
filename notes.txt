TODO:
Core board interactivity
    - add new column
    - add new task
Task-level interactivity  
    - click task:
        - open modal showing full details
        - allow editing or deleting of task
Subtask completion toggles
    in task modal:
        - render checklist of subtasks
        - allow toggling each isCompleted
        - update that task's subtasks in context
Move task between columns (status change)
    inside task modal (or via drag and drop later)
        - changing the "status" should move the task to corresponding column
    if not doing drag and drop yet, let user pick a column from dropdown and update

    Allow users to:
        - drag tasks between columns
        - drag to reorder tasks
    - Persist data
        - use localstorage to persist boards
        - API
    - Edit and Delete Boards/columns
        - add dropdowns or context menus
